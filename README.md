YouTube Video Transcription and Summarization App
This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to search for YouTube videos, fetch their transcripts, and generate concise text summaries of the content using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). It leverages the YouTube Data API, the YouTube Transcript API, and natural language processing techniques.

Features
YouTube Search: Search for YouTube videos based on a query.
Transcript Fetching: Retrieve video transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API.
Text Summarization: Summarize video transcripts into concise text summaries using NLTK.
Interactive UI: Display video titles, transcripts, summaries, and video previews within the app.
Tech Stack
Backend:
YouTube Data API for video search.
YouTube Transcript API for fetching transcripts.
NLTK for natural language processing and summarization.
Frontend:
Streamlit for creating a responsive and user-friendly web app.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher.
A valid YouTube Data API key.
Required Python libraries:
google-api-python-client

Known Issues
Some videos might not have available transcripts due to restrictions (e.g., auto-generated subtitles or private content).
Summarization might not always produce accurate results for very short transcripts.
Future Enhancements
Integrate a more advanced summarization model (e.g., using Hugging Face or OpenAI APIs).
Add support for multilingual transcription and summarization.
Improve UI/UX with better styling and visualizations.
